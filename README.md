Contains my OSX config for bash, vim, node, etc.

*8/17/17*<br/>
Updated vim rc plugin settings. 

*7/29/17*<br/>
Saw https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles dotfiles and was inspired to rewrite mine. Added shell scripts that automated installation of brew, node, git as well as OS X apps. ACTUALLY HAVE TO RUN/TEST THIS AT SOME POINT.

*7/23/17*<br/>
Set-up basic skeleton for bash profile and vim configuration
Added some simple aliases

**TO-DOs**
- Figure out what everything in .bashrc does
- see if there's a safe way to automate setting up git configuration
- see if there's a way to automate installing apps/configuration on my desktop machine?
- Level up in BASH
- look at Erik's and Afra's dotfiles see what I can learn
- update dotfiles to install vim plugins: ctrlp, vim airline, and NERDTree
