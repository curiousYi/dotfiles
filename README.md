dotfiles
=======
Contains my OSX config for bash, vim, node, etc.
*7/1/19*<br/>
Updating some shell scripts I haven't run for a while.
Need to go through install_dotfiles again and fix the broken parts.

*8/17/17*<br/>
Updated vim rc plugin settings. 

*7/29/17*<br/>
Saw https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles dotfiles and was inspired to rewrite mine. Added shell scripts that automated installation of brew, node, git as well as OS X apps. ACTUALLY HAVE TO RUN/TEST THIS AT SOME POINT.

*7/23/17*<br/>
Set-up basic skeleton for bash profile and vim configuration
Added some simple aliases

**TO-DOs**
- Remedy the broken install scripts for OSX and apps install.sh
- Used brew cask install to set-up initial stuff.
